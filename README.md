## Hi there, I'm Nandini 👋

🚀 A passionate **Cloud Engineer** with a strong focus on **AWS**, **DevOps**, and building **scalable, resilient, and cost-effective** systems in the cloud.

💡 I thrive at the intersection of **engineering** and **ops**, where reliability meets innovation.

🧠 I'm a continuous learner — always experimenting with new tools, tech stacks, and best practices in cloud architecture, CI/CD, containerization, and observability.

---

### 🛠️ Areas I work in:
- **AWS,Azure Cloud Infrastructure**
- **DevOps & Automation** (Terraform, Ansible, GitHub Actions, CloudFormation)
- **Containerization** (Docker, ECS, EKS, Kubernetes)
- **Observability** (New Relic, CloudWatch, Prometheus)
- **Security & Resilience Engineering**

---

📚 I love to document my learning journey through **daily projects** and **technical blogs** — hoping to help and be helped by the awesome developer community.

🚢 Let's build better systems — one container, one script, and one idea at a time.

🌱 Always learning new tech and sharing knowledge.
